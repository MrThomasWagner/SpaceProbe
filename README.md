SpaceProbe
==========
Just for fun!

Got the idea from http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2o5tb7/2014123_challenge_191_intermediate_space_probe/

Implemented as a web-based-application to get my hands dirty with Spring+Tomcat again and practice design patterns.  Finds a path via the A* algorithm.
